"""Shim to provide websockets.asyncio.client.ClientConnection expected by realtime 1.0.6.

The realtime package imports:
    from websockets.asyncio.client import ClientConnection

In websockets 12.0 the public layout changed; the asyncio namespace package
may not be present in certain distributions. We map the expected symbol to
websockets.client.connect return type by creating a lightweight proxy.

If a future upgrade provides the proper package, this shim becomes a no-op.
