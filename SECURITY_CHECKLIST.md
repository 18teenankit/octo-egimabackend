# Security Checklist for CortejTech Backend

## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (DO THESE NOW)

### 1. Rotate ALL Exposed Credentials
- [ ] **Supabase**: Generate new service role key and anon key
- [ ] **Resend**: Generate new API key  
- [ ] **Auth0**: Generate new client secret and Auth0 secret
- [ ] **reCAPTCHA**: Generate new secret key
- [ ] **JWT**: Generate new strong secret (32+ characters)
- [ ] **Admin Session**: Generate new HMAC secret

### 2. Secure Environment Files
- [ ] Remove current `.env` file from version control
- [ ] Create new `.env` with rotated credentials
- [ ] Verify `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] Never commit `.env` files again

### 3. Production Settings
- [ ] Set `ENVIRONMENT=production`
- [ ] Set `DEBUG=false`
- [ ] Use strong JWT secret (32+ chars)
- [ ] Limit CORS origins to production domains only

## üõ°Ô∏è ONGOING SECURITY MEASURES

### 4. Access Control
- [ ] Review admin email list
- [ ] Implement principle of least privilege
- [ ] Regular access review (monthly)

### 5. Database Security
- [ ] Review Supabase RLS policies
- [ ] Limit database permissions
- [ ] Enable database audit logging
- [ ] Regular backup verification

### 6. API Security
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled
- [ ] Security headers implemented
- [ ] Input validation on all endpoints
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak info

### 7. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry)
- [ ] Log security events
- [ ] Monitor API usage patterns
- [ ] Set up alerting for anomalies

### 8. Regular Security Tasks
- [ ] Weekly: Review logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Monthly: Update dependencies
- [ ] Quarterly: Security audit
- [ ] Yearly: Penetration testing

## üîç VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT

### Current Risk Level: üî¥ CRITICAL
- **Public exposure of production credentials**
- **Full database access via service key**
- **Email system compromise possible**
- **Admin authentication bypass possible**

### After Fixes: üü° MEDIUM
- Environment properly secured
- Credentials rotated
- Production settings applied
- Monitoring in place

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

After implementing fixes:
- [ ] No secrets in code repository
- [ ] Environment variables properly set
- [ ] Application starts without errors
- [ ] All APIs require proper authentication
- [ ] Rate limiting is working
- [ ] CORS is properly configured
- [ ] Security headers are present

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT SECURITY

### Production Deployment
- [ ] Use environment variables (not .env file)
- [ ] Implement secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)
- [ ] Use HTTPS only
- [ ] Enable security headers
- [ ] Configure proper firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting

### Container Security (if using Docker)
- [ ] Use minimal base images
- [ ] Run as non-root user
- [ ] Scan images for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Keep containers updated

## üìû INCIDENT RESPONSE

If you suspect a security breach:
1. **Immediately rotate all credentials**
2. **Check access logs for unauthorized activity**
3. **Notify users if data may be compromised**
4. **Document the incident**
5. **Implement additional security measures**
